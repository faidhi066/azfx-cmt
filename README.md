## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd azfx-cmt
```

2. Create & Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set Up Environment Variables
   Create a .env file in the root directory with the following contents:

```bash
CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
SQL_CONNECTION_STRING=your-sql-connection-string
APP_ID=your-teams-app-id
```

5. Run the Application Locally

```bash
func start
```

6. Debugging
   Use the VS Code debugger configuration provided in .vscode/launch.json.

## üîë Key Features

### ‚úÖ Fetch User Details

‚Ä¢ Retrieves user details from Microsoft Teams channels using the Microsoft Graph API
‚Ä¢ Supports concurrent requests for improved performance

### ‚úÖ Install Teams Apps

‚Ä¢ Installs a specified Microsoft Teams app for all users in a channel

### ‚úÖ Store User Data

‚Ä¢ Inserts user details into an Azure SQL database using a Table-Valued Parameter (TVP) approach

### ‚úÖ Timer Trigger

‚Ä¢ Executes the workflow periodically based on the cron schedule defined in function_app.py

## üö¢ Deployment

1. Deploy to Azure

Use Azure Functions Core Tools:

```bash
func azure functionapp publish <YOUR_FUNCTION_APP_NAME>
```

2. Configure Application Settings in Azure

In the Azure Portal, navigate to your Function App:

Settings > Configuration

Add the following environment variables:
‚Ä¢ CLIENT_ID
‚Ä¢ TENANT_ID
‚Ä¢ CLIENT_SECRET
‚Ä¢ SQL_CONNECTION_STRING
‚Ä¢ APP_ID

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

‚Ä¢ Never commit sensitive information such as secrets or connection strings. Use environment variables and .env files locally, and Azure Key Vault in production.
‚Ä¢ The .gitignore and .funcignore files are configured to exclude sensitive files and unnecessary deployment artifacts.
